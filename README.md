- 👋 Hi there, 
-  I’m a hydrologist passionate about data analysis and remote sensing. I have a background in civil engineering and Python is the coding language that I have used the most, but I can read and work also on Matlab and R. I started to upload my codes not so long ago but I have about 3 years of experience coding for hydrological andd environmental applications. 


- 🔭 I’m currently working on data analysis, machine learning and integrating remote sensing and python for hydrological applications
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced python features, advanced geopandas, Flopy and TensorFlow
- 💞️ I believe open source is a key to development.
