- 👋 Hi there, 
-  I’m a hydrologist passionate about large-sample hydrology. Python is the coding language that I have used the most, but I can read and work also on Matlab and R. I have about 7 years of experience coding for hydrological andd environmental applications. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on data analysis, machine learning and integrating remote sensing and python for hydrological applications
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced python features and how to optimize big data handling.  
- 💞️ I believe open source is a key to development.
